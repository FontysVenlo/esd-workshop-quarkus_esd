# Quarkus

## What is Quarkus?
- Supersonic, Subatomic Java: Designed for fast startup & tiny memoryâ€”great for containers, serverless, and microservices.

- Build-time augmentation: Moves lots of framework work from run time to build time (CDI wiring, JAX-RS, ORM metadata, config).

- Developer joy: quarkus dev hot reload, live coding, Dev UI, Dev Services (auto-start Kafka, Postgres, etc. via Testcontainers).

- Two modes: JVM mode (fast dev) and native (GraalVM/mandrel) for super-fast startup & low RSS.

- Familiar APIs: JAX-RS (RESTEasy Reactive), CDI (Arc), Hibernate ORM with Panache, Liquibase/Flyway, SmallRye (OpenAPI, Health, Metrics, JWT/OIDC, Reactive Messaging), Scheduler, Mailer, etc.
